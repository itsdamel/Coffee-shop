# Coffee-shop
 
I've created this a while ago and decided to add it to my repository now that I've learnt how to make a responsive page :)
It's landing page for a coffee shop that was developed for one of the front-end courses I was taking at the time. 

It has helped me practice and apply flexbox concepts, as well as positioning using vanilla CSS.

You can see it working <a href="https://itsdamel.github.io/Coffee-shop/" target="_blank"> here</a>
